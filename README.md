# ComLabSound
## Inspiration 
We wanted to simulate a broken home. The feeling that there is no place to go, and no place to run.
## Code
The code for this project was fairly simple. Each door had it's own sound and image that were loaded the first time it was clicked.
Once a door was clicked it would be marked visited on a boolean array. And once all basic doors we're clicked a new door would show up, one leading to a gentler place, the child's own room.
