# ComLabSound
## Project Description 
We wanted to simulate a broken home.  We wanted to showcase the feeling that one has when they have nowhere to turn to, when they had no agency in their movement. As such we made the rooms unescapable until their own piece of media finished, making the whole experience more suffocating.
## Process
Filip was in charge of getting the raw audio and the coding, while Hanneen was in charge of echancing the audio to get the maximum effect out of the scenes.
## Reflection/Evaluation
Though we were very happy with the sound editing, the raw sound used in both the arguement scene and the brother scene left a bit to be desired. The final working version was satisfactory, though the atmoshpere could have possibly been amped more with better animations, the overall result was something we were happy with.
## Code
The code for this project was fairly simple. Each door had it's own sound and image that were loaded the first time it was clicked.
Once a door was clicked it would be marked visited on a boolean array. And once all basic doors we're clicked a new door would show up, one leading to a gentler place, the child's own room.
